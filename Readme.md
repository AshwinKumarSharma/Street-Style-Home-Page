## Learnings from this project

- Learned about how to use selectors to add styles to them.
- Got good understanding of positions and how to use them.
- Learned about the property z-index that control the stacking order of elements on a web page along the z-axis.

## Time Taken to finish the project

I have not been tracking the time honestly but I guess it took me around 3.5 to 4 hours.
